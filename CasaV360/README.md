## This is a WEB APP in Laravel 8

## Context: 
My client bought a 360 camera in order to offer a 3D modelling service to his own customers. He just wants a small application to display his contact information and services, but also to communicate with potential customers via a contact form, Finally he wants to retrieve the email addresses in his DB

## App
The application is a Landing Page which allows to put forward the concept of virtual visit to buy real estate.
I get an already existing theme to modify it,
the goal is to make the back-end and manage the sending of contact mail of the customer via a form.
For the admin I didn't use packages like Jetstream or Voyager ect... I tried to make the most of the basic possibilities that Laravel offers us.
This can be changed later...
